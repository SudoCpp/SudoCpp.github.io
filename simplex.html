                <h2>Simplex Toolkit</h2>
                <p>
                    The Simplex Toolkit is a set of C++ classes with the goals to make C++ development
                    as easy as possible. Often the approach with C++ projects has become &quot;write 
                    the parts that need to be fast in C/C++ and write the rest in something else&quot;.
                    That approach does work, but how do you mesh the two together? COM? While there are 
                    multiple solutions. The approach for the Simplex Toolkit is write everything in C++
                    in a simle fashion and then if something is extermely speed crtical, just write that
                    part the way you desire.
                </p>
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a very object oriented approach.</li>
                    <li>Make development as fast and easy as possible.</li>
                    <li>Be lightweight.</li>
                    <li>Automate memory management through RAII.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Namespaces are all lowercase.</li>
                    <li>Member functions/methods are camelCase (starting with lowercase)</li>
                    <li>Classes are PascalCase (starting with uppercase)</li>
                    <li>If a function calls for a pointer (*) it is taking over ownership. (You no longer need to free/delete it)</li>
                    <li>If a function calls for a reference (&) ownership is not transferred.</li>
                </ul>
