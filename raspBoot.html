                <p>
                    Here is the code we need for boot.S
                </p>
                <pre>
    // To keep this in the first portion of the binary.
    .section ".text.boot"

    // Make _start global.
    .global _start

    // Entry point for the kernel.
    // r15 -> should begin execution at 0x8000.
    // r0 -> 0x00000000
    // r1 -> 0x00000C42 - machine id
    // r2 -> 0x00000100 - start of ATAGS
    // preserve these registers as argument for kernel_main
    _start:
        // Shut off extra cores
        mrc p15, #0, r1, c0, c0, #5
        and r1, r1, #3
        cmp r1, #0
        bne halt

        // Setup the stack.
        mov sp, #0x8000

        // Clear out bss.
        ldr r4, =__bss_start
        ldr r9, =__bss_end
        mov r5, #0
        mov r6, #0
        mov r7, #0
        mov r8, #0
        b       2f

    1:
        stmia r4!, {r5-r8}

    2:
        cmp r4, r9
        blo 1b

        // Call kernel_main
        ldr r3, =kernel_main
        blx r3

    halt:
        wfe
        b halt
                </pre>
                <p>
                    First we have `.section ".text.boot"`. This is so that the linker knows 
                    how to place our code at 0x8000. Supposedly, this shouldn't be needed but 
                    since we are going to ELF format first it requires this, and then we strip 
                    it down to binary. This part I don't fully understand, but I'll take the
                    tutorial's word for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the CPU are tiny chunks of memory called registers. For ARM they are 
                    simply called r0 through r15. When you write a program you will use many
                    variables. The CPU only has access to these 16 registers. Before our program 
                    is called r0, r1 and r2 will be set with values that we want to preserve.
                    This is why you will notice that r0-r2 isn't called or used anywhere here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First since this is Raspberry PI 2 we will need to turn off all the cores except
                    for 1.
                </p>
                <pre>
    // Shut off extra cores
    mrc p15, #0, r1, c0, c0, #5
    and r1, r1, #3
    cmp r1, #0
    bne halt
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Jake's tutorial says that writing a kernel for 1 processor core is hard enough,
                    so we shut the others down to make our lives easier. The tutorial from the OSDev
                    wiki says that we do this by putting them in an infinite loop. I'm not exactly 
                    sure how the cores are determined. I do know for Raspberry PI 1, this code is 
                    not needed since it is single core'd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next there is `mov sp, #0x8000`. This sets the register `sp` to 0x8000 where `sp`
                    is a special register points to the base of the stack. (sp stands for stack pointer.)
                    This is so that C or C++ will be able to start to save values to the stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other thing to make C and C++ run is that the BSS section must be defined.
                    This section of code does that:
                </p>
                <pre>
            ldr r4, =__bss_start
            ldr r9, =__bss_end
            mov r5, #0
            mov r6, #0
            mov r7, #0
            mov r8, #0
            b       2f
        
        1:
            stmia r4!, {r5-r8}
        
        2:
            cmp r4, r9
            blo 1b
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Essentially what this section of code does is that it sets the range in memory
                    from the address of __bss_start to __bss_end all to zeros. Looking at the code we see this
                    Here the address of __bss_start and __bss_end are stored into r4 and r9.
                    These two values come from the linker. Next r5-r8 are then set to zero. 
                    The line `stmia r4!, {r5-r8}` does quite a bit. A C equivlent would be this:
                </p>
                <pre>
    #define __bss_start = 0x1234 //whatever this address is it is assigned by the linker
    #define __bss_end = 0x4567 //also assigned by the linker
    uint32_t* r4 = __bss_start; //ldr r4, =_bss_start (real registers not accessable from C just an example)
    uint32_t* r9 = __bss_end; //ldr r9, =__bss_end
    uint32_t r5 = 0; //mov r5, #0
    uint32_t r6 = 0; //mov r6, #0
    uint32_t r7 = 0; //mov r7, #0
    uint32_t r8 = 0; //mov r8, #0
    goto _2; //b 2f

    _1: // 1:
    //Next part is harder to explain but I'll give it a try
    *r4 = r5; //stm part of stmia r4!, {r5-r8}
    r4++; 
    *r4 = r6;
    r4++;
    *r4 = r7;
    r4++;
    *r4 = r8; // ! part means to hang on to the last address you ended at.
    r4++; //ia means increment after to get to the next address.

    _2: // 2:
    if (r4 < r9) // cmp r4, r9 (the address not the value)
        goto _1; // blo 1b (branch lo wer)
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Next we call the kernel_main C function. First we load the address of that
                    function into the register and then go to (branch to) that function. A
                    special attribute of BLX is that when kernel_main returns, it will come back
                    to this spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last, we have our halt label. WFE basically means, wait for an event. Then branch
                    back to halt and do this forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well there is the boot.S file. It took quite a while to explain, but after you
                    copy the code and things work the way you want if you have no idea how they 
                    work, when something goes wrong you have no idea what to do to fix things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next section will look at making some C++ files and how they work.
