                <h2>Assembly</h2>
                <p>
                    Assembly is a unique language. It is also unlike any other language in that it is
                    an untyped language and it has direct access to the CPUs internals. It gives the programmer
                    control over everything, but the programmer must "think like the computer" in a manner of speaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter what processor you have, when it is turned on it will start at a specific address and
                    start to look for a command to execute. If there is no firmware the address pins be set to the address
                    to the start address and then it will read in data on the data pins, looking for a command to execute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CPU itself is extremely basic in its functionality. It will have some built in registers,
                    which are basically like global variables that the entire processor uses. Math can be done with these.
                    Then there are address pins that are used to refer to a specific RAM address and there are data pins 
                    (data bus), that can either send bits out or read bits in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's look at an example with the z80 processor, since you can still buy these and put them on a breadboard.
                    When the process receives power it will set it's address pins to $0 and read in what it should do. Assuming
                    that the address pins are connected to an EEPROM, the memory chip will send the first command to the z80,
                    and then it will set the address pins to the address for $1.
